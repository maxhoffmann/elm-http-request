# Elm Http Request Example

This Elm app was built while writing [my tutorial on how to do HTTP requests in Elm](https://maximilianhoffmann.com/posts/making-http-requests-in-elm). It shows how to use the `StartApp` package to do side effects, like HTTP requests and parse the JSON response. It was built in three steps, which are explained in the blog post and can be viewed as Git diffs as well:

**Step 1:** [Basic Setup](https://github.com/maxhoffmann/elm-http-request/commit/354b891946751a8f82380254ff265792e60450dc)

**Step 2:** [Use StartApp package](https://github.com/maxhoffmann/elm-http-request/commit/bc8aced46653bd51e86c1e9c61847b8ff5ba354d)

**Step 3:** [Make HTTP request and decode JSON](https://github.com/maxhoffmann/elm-http-request/commit/f3aa112423dfdc1489d60b231747a3ce6471eca8)
